# WTF is the Raid Guild?

The Raid Guild is a dao for builders to form Raid Parties and team up on epic boss fights (open source web3 projects). Development, Design, Marketing, Product, Cryptoeconomics.

## Manifesto

- We believe in Web3, and are here to build it, use it, propagate it.
- We ONLY accept crypto.

## How we work

### Raid Parties

A Raid Party is a small agile team built from members of the Guild. Raid Parties can be formed to tackle both internal and external projects.

### External Projects

External projects can hire the Raid Guild to help them. External projects are taxed 10% which goes back to the Guild Bank. Funds in the Guild Bank can then be deployed to internal projects.

### Internal Projects

Internal projects are our own ideas from the Guild. Can be funded directly by the Guild or an external funder.
